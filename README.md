# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Import CSV: Develop a process to import the sales CSV file into a relational database that supports SQL queries, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.

Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

Data Exploration: Explore the sales data by querying the database using SQL to gain insights into different aspects of the sales, such as product performance, customer behavior, and regional trends.

Data Aggregation: Utilize SQL aggregation functions to calculate metrics like total revenue, average order value, or sales by product category. This can help in identifying top-selling products, revenue contributions, and other key performance indicators.

Time-Series Analysis: Apply time-series analysis techniques using SQL to examine sales trends over time, identify seasonality patterns, and analyze sales performance by month, quarter, or year.

Joining Tables: If your dataset includes multiple CSV files or database tables, perform SQL joins to combine relevant information and create a comprehensive view of the sales data. For example, joining customer data with sales data to analyze customer behavior.

Data Visualization: Use data visualization tools like Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards, charts, and reports. These visualizations can help in presenting key findings, trends, and patterns from the sales data.

Drill-Down Analysis: Implement drill-down capabilities in your visualizations to allow users to explore the sales data at different levels of granularity. For example, enabling users to drill down from overall sales to specific regions, products, or time periods.

Filtering and Slicing: Enable interactive filtering and slicing options in the visualizations to let users focus on specific segments or subsets of the sales data. This can provide a more detailed and targeted analysis of sales performance.
